# GUI Ground Station

The [command line ground station](https://github.com/huiminlim/ground_stn) was built previous, so it's time for the GUI ground station to be built.

The GUI ground station is envisioned to be built with Electron JS on Python.

With Electron JS and Python, the advantages include:

- Modern looking GUI interface developed with frontend web technologies.

- Avoid dated Python GUI frameworks.

- Python backend that is capable of reading Serial ports on local PC machines.
