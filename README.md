## Features

The Ground Station app has several functions to interact with the CubeSat.

### Port Setup

To setup the Ground Station, connect the 2 transceivers to talk to the TT&C and Payload to your laptop.

The transceivers need a intermediary bridge to connect its pins to the USB ports of laptops and an USB adapter is used.

This is how the TT&C transceiver connected to the USB adapter.
