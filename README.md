# Dreams2space GUI Ground Station

The Dream2space Cubesat is an educational cubesat assembled as part of a Final Year Project done in my undergraduate days in the National University of Singapore.

The hardware system design and software designed were done as part of the project, while the PCB and CAD design/ printing were done by folks from the iDP lab in NUS.

The Dream2space Cubesat was also contracted and used by participants in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) [Brainhack](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/whats-on/spotlight/into-the-multiverse-and-beyond) SpaceCube workshop, as featured [here](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/digital-technology-gets-a-boost-in-interest-as-more-students-attend-annual-brainhack-event).

## Getting Started

The Dream2space GUI Ground Station allows you to interact with your Dream2space Cubesat.

You can issue mission commands entirely from a GUI interface with great ease.

## Why?

The [command line ground station](https://github.com/huiminlim/ground_stn) was built previously, so it's time for the GUI ground station to be built.
