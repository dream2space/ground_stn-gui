# Setup

## Install Electron JS

Install Node JS from the isntaller.

Install Electron binaries locally using the following commands.

```bash
npm install electron --save-dev
```

A folder `node_modules` will be created in the workspace. For lean sake, will not commit to the repo and exclude in `.gitignore`.
